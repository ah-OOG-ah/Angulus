License headers must be applied to new files and updated to existing ones as per the template. The LGPLv3 by itself is in LICENSE, but the GPLv3 and LGPLv3 are also in COPYING and COPYING.LESSER as per FSF convention.

Some third-party code was used in this project. See 3RD-PARTY-LICENSES for details.

All four of these files should be kept in sync with the ones in src/main/resources. I would just symlink them, but that may cause issues for people checking out the repository on different platforms.
